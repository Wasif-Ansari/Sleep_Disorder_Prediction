# Sleep_Disorder_Prediction

## Project Summary:
The primary goal of this data science endeavor is to analyze diverse lifestyle and medical parameters of individuals, such as age, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, blood pressure, etc. This information will be used to forecast the likelihood and type of sleep disorder a person might face. Conditions like Insomnia and Sleep Apnea can significantly affect an individual's health and general well-being. By recognizing those prone to sleep disorders, appropriate interventions and treatments can be administered to enhance their sleep quality and overall health.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset employed in this project is known as the "Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset." It encompasses 400 entries (individuals) and 13 attributes (variables) that encompass a wide spectrum of information concerning sleep habits and daily routines. The dataset encompasses the following pivotal features:

1. **Comprehensive Sleep Metrics:** This section allows exploration of various sleep-related metrics such as sleep duration, sleep quality, and factors influencing sleep patterns.

2. **Lifestyle Factors:** The dataset offers insights into lifestyle factors like physical activity levels, stress levels, and BMI categories, which may impact an individual's sleep health.

3. **Cardiovascular Health:** The dataset incorporates measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, pivotal indicators of an individual's cardiovascular health that may correlate with sleep disorders.

4. **Sleep Disorder Analysis:** The primary objective of this project is to discern the presence or absence of sleep disorders in individuals. The dataset classifies individuals into three categories in the "Sleep Disorder" column:

   - None: Individuals who do not exhibit any specific sleep disorder.
   - Insomnia: Individuals who experience difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep.
   - Sleep Apnea: Individuals who suffer from pauses in breathing during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks.
